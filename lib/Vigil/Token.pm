=head1 NAME

Vigil::Token - Cryptographically secure, URL-safe token generator for OTPs, sessions, and custom codes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over 4

    EXAMPLE 1.
    #!/user/bin/perl
	
    use Vigil::Token;
    my $token = Vigil::Token->new;
	
    my $session_token = $token->custom_token(256);
	
    my $short_token = $token->custom_token(12);
	
    my $some_token = $token->(16);    #An alias for $token->custom_token(16);
	
    my $digits_be_6_for_otp = $token->otp(6);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Vigil::Token is a sleek, high-octane token generator that effortlessly handles both human-friendly codes and 
machine-to-machine secrets. Need a short, 6-digit OTP that users can type without mistaking a 0 for an O? 
Done. Looking for a massive, 256-character session token to lock down API calls or web sessions? Done. 
Every token is backed by cryptographically strong randomness using Bytes::Random::Secure, ensuring each 
byte of entropy is truly unpredictable. All strings are automatically URL-safe via Base64URL encoding, 
so they slide seamlessly into cookies, query strings, or HTML forms without worrying about escaping. With 
its flexible custom_token() function, Vigil::Token balances readability and security perfectly: short codes 
are human-friendly, long codes maximize entropy, and all tokens are guaranteed to be the exact length you 
request. Lightweight, reliable, and unrelentingly secure, Vigil::Token is the ultimate Swiss Army knife for 
modern web authentication and cryptographic token needs.

=head2 OBJECT METHODS

=over 4

=item my $one_time_password = $obj-E<gt>otp( LENGTH )

Returns a string of digits only. Will return up to 12 digits as specified by LENGTH.

=item $obj->custom_token( LENGTH );

Returns a string that is automatically URL-safe via Base64URL encoding. The number of characters in the string is determined by LENGTH.

=head2 Local Installation

If your host does not allow you to install from CPAN, then you can install this module locally two ways:

=over 4

=item * Same Directory

In the same directory as your script, create a subdirectory called "Vigil". Then add these two lines, in this order, to your script:

	use lib '.';           # Add current directory to @INC
	use Vigil::Token;      # Now Perl can find the module in the same dir
	
	#Then call it as normal:
	my $token = Vigil::Token->new;

=item * In a different directory

First, create a subdirectory called "Vigil" then add it to C<@INC> array through a C<BEGIN{}> block in your script:

	#!/usr/bin/perl
	BEGIN {
		push(@INC, '/path/on/server/to/Vigil');
	}
	
	use Vigil::Token;
	
	#Then call it as normal:
	my $token = Vigil::Token->new;
